    This starter kit contains what you need to create best practice rules for the Dynamics 365 Unified Operations platform.
    In particular, you may use this starter kit as a starting point for writing:<br />

    <table class="auto-style1 mytable1" >
        <tr>
            <td class="auto-style2 td-top">Metadata rules</td>
            <td>This template allows you to author rules that apply to metadata artifacts, like menus, menuitems etc.&nbsp; You would typically use LINQ to query the object graphs that represent the metadata.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="auto-style2 td-top">X++ Code rules</td>
            <td>This template allows you to author rules that apply to code artifacts, like classes and forms. You typically do this by providing a subclass of the ASTSweeper class, overriding the methods that pertain to the situation you want to diagnose. </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

        The examples shown are standalone checks that actually work: The rules are not terribly interesting in their own right;
        they are designed to serve as good starting points for your own rules.

    <p>
        When you have created your own rules, you can import them into Dynamics 365 for Operations by using the Best Practice dialog from Visual Studio.
